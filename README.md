# Fantastic labels and where to find them

In the quest of an optimized research in Google Drive, many teams asked me to place some metadata on their documents and files. 

Widespread in Microsoft environment, this tool is not really known in Google Drive by users.

As Google Workspace admin or may I say wizards, we can use some little tricks to answer teams requirements.  

First, we can create labels with the team : [Create label in the admin console](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en_fm&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F13127870%3Fhl%3Den_fm&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=13127870&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)

The label can have  different fields like list, number, text,..

Once the label is created, it needs to be secure and visible by the right people. 
An invisibility cloak can be used by setting up some parameters like who can edit or see the label.

Once the spell the label is ready, we need to apply it on every files the user/team wants.
 
2 options are available :
